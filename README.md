# capstone-project2: Airline Passenger Satisfaction

This project analyzes an airline satisfaction dataset from Kaggle as a part of Purwadhika Data Science class module 2 evaluation. The dataset contains information on passenger demographics, travel characteristics, and satisfaction ratings for three different classes of passengers: Economy, Economy Plus, and Business.

## Background
The airline industry is one of the most competitive industries in the world. The level of competition among airlines has become increasingly fierce over the years, and one of the keys to success in this industry is to provide an exceptional passenger experience. To remain competitive, airlines need to constantly monitor passenger satisfaction levels and make data-driven decisions to improve their services.

## Problem Statement
The aim of this analysis is to understand the factors that influence passenger satisfaction with airlines, and to provide insights and recommendations to airlines on understanding their customer profile and preferences. The analysis will focus on explore the following key questions:
1. Does the passengers' satisfaction level vary significantly depending on the class they are traveling in (Economy, Business, or Eco Plus)?
1. If does, What are the factors that influence passenger satisfaction with airlines based on their class type?
